# Container orchestration - Kubernetes
## Description

Build a multi node Kubernetes cluster for testing using Vagrant, composed by a Master Node (manager node “orchestrator”) and several Worker nodes. Use Ansible to automate software configuration management for the nodes, i.e., setup of the Master node (the kubernetes orchestrator) and  welcoming the worker nodes, deploying in them the “nginx” webserver.
